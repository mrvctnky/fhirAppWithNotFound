## The Vision - SMART on FHIR - EHR as an Open Platform
Think of EHR's less as a solution and more as a platform on top of which solutions can be delivered.

An App Store for innovative clinical apps that can "plug and play" inside any compliant EHR.
A new kind of App Store is the SMART platform.
Modern EHRs are becoming platforms and because no single vendor can supply every needed function,
it would be nice to use "edge extensions" to complete the functionality.
Many vendors have proprietary APIs for extensions so it's impossible to plug app extensions into the clinical workflow.

**What's so special about SMART?**
*What we have done with SMART is try to get App developers the entire stack of technology and support they need to build a tool that plug in in EHRs and we want to help them plug into different kinds of EHRs without having to understand all the internal differences between those systems. So if I'm building an app that needs to plug in any EHR, I should be able to build using the same tools.
FHIR for the Data Model
Authorization and Security with OAuth
& a set of guidelines about exactly how to use those standards."* Josh Mandel, SMART on FHIR

The Open Source apps I picked:

[The Growth Chart App][1]
[The Cardiac Risk App][2],
and the [Blood Pressure Centiles][3]

The Growth Chart App and the Blood Pressure Centiles are designed for clinicians.
The Cardiac Risk App is designed for both, the clinician and the patient.
